# Next-word-prediction-project

This project explores various machine learning approaches to implement a Next Word Prediction system. The goal is to predict the most probable next word given a sequence of words. We have implemented and compared multiple techniques, including statistical models, traditional machine learning algorithms, and advanced deep learning models.
